Usage
=====
- Activate the color scheme you want to edit (**it must be editable file on your disk, not file inside `.sublime-package`, aka `.zip`. You can unzip it, put it in your packages folder somewhere, e.g. `Packages/SomeWhere`, select the theme and then you can use this plugin**).
- Open some file and press Shift+F12.
- Your color scheme should open in separate pane.
- As you put the cursor on different source elements, the other pane will find and display the XML element that is affecting this element.
- If more than one style element affect the code element, the most relevant style match is displayed first and you can go to other matches with Ctrl+Alt+Right and Ctrl+Alt+Left.
- Change the styles as you wish and save so Sublime Text will reload the styles and display your changes.
- When you are done editing press Shift+F12 again or close the view of the scheme file.
